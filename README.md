# SQ APP FOR PAX is rewritten in Angular6 and Bootstrap 4

## Introduction

JUST FULL aims to leverage on choosing passengers who view being bumped as a ticket to perks. Using the technology of streamlining and automating the current offloading process, the app scores and prioritize passengers according to their willingness to be voluntary offloaded. Since the search for volunteers will be completed before the departure date of the flights, airport staff will be able to provide a more efficient service, while passengers can enjoy a seamless experience flying SQ.

## Page Explain

### Offer Page

After target passengers receive the offer email, they can access the Offer WebApp, both accessible on mobile and desktop. The web page displays the original flight itinerary, 2 compensation options and 2 alternative flights options to choose from, providing personalized offer to each individual. One of the compensation option is a full package with accomodation, free upgrade to Premium Economy Class and monetary compensation; the other one is a larger amount of monetary compensation only, which better match passengers who live in the origin city. To ensure the voluntary offloading process can be completed by departure date, offers are advised to be sent out 48-hour before the flight and allows a 24-hour consideration period to each passenger. 

### Confirmation Page

After choosing compensation option and alternative flight, passengers can click accept and land on ‘Confirmation Page’. To ideally provide instant compensation, payment method allows credit and debit card transaction. 

### Kris Shop Promo Code Page
After they offer the compensation, confirmation email will be sent with a KrisShop promotional code for passengers to enjoy the greatest shopping experience.
